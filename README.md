# Issuify ðŸš€

Issuify simplifies issue creation by allowing you to convert a plain text list of future GitHub issues into actual issues on your repository. No more manual entryâ€”just write your list, run Issuify, and let it do the work for you!

# Features
âœ… Convert a simple text list into GitHub issues </br>
âœ… Save time by automating issue creation</br>
âœ… Easy to use, no complex setup required

Perfect for project planning, backlog grooming, and quickly adding multiple issues without hassle.

## Setup
Before using Issuify, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** installed on your machine.
- **A GitHub App** with an **Application ID** and **Private Key**.

To create a GitHub App:
1. Go to **GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ GitHub Apps**.
2. Click **New GitHub App** and configure it.
3. Generate and download the private key.
4. Note the Application ID.

Then, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```env
GITHUB_APP_ID=your_github_app_id
REPOSITORY_LINK=https://api.github.com/repos/username/repo-name  # Replace with your actual GitHub username and repository name
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=your_github_app_private_key
```

## Usage

Optionally, you can create and manage your milestones by adding them to the `milestones.txt` file in the `data/` directory. The milestones should be in the following format:

```
MILESTONE_CODE =  Milestone Title
MILESTONE_CODE =  Milestone Title
```

Issuify expects your issue list to follow this structure:

```
First line: Title  
Other lines: Body (empty lines are allowed, empty lines between title and body are removed)  
3 empty lines separate each issue  
```

if you want to add a milestone to an issue, add the milestone code at the start of the issue title (optionally followed by a number) and divide milestone's code and issue title with a `-`. For example:

```
MILESTONE_CODE - Issue Title
Other lines: Body (empty lines are allowed, empty lines between title and body are removed)
3 empty lines separate each issue


MILESTONE_CODE123 - Issue Title
Other lines: Body (empty lines are allowed, empty lines between title and body are removed)
3 empty lines separate each issue
```

Complete example:
[issue without milestones](data-example/simple-issues.txt)
[milestones](data-example/milestones.txt)
[issue with milestones](data-example/issues.txt)


The list of issues should be in a file named `issues.txt` in the `data/` directory.

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
