# Issuify ðŸš€

Issuify simplifies issue creation by allowing you to convert a plain text list of future GitHub issues into actual issues on your repository. No more manual entryâ€”just write your list, run Issuify, and let it do the work for you!

# Features
âœ… Convert a simple text list into GitHub issues
âœ… Save time by automating issue creation
âœ… Easy to use, no complex setup required

Perfect for project planning, backlog grooming, and quickly adding multiple issues without hassle.

## Setup
Before using Issuify, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** installed on your machine.
- **A GitHub App** with an **Application ID** and **Private Key**.

To create a GitHub App:
1. Go to **GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ GitHub Apps**.
2. Click **New GitHub App** and configure it.
3. Generate and download the private key.
4. Note the Application ID.

Then, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

```env
GITHUB_APP_ID=your_github_app_id
REPOSITORY_LINK=https://api.github.com/repos/username/repo-name  # Replace with your actual GitHub username and repository name
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=your_github_app_private_key
```

## Usage

Issuify expects your issue list to follow this structure:

```
First line: Title  
Other lines: Body (empty lines are allowed, empty lines between title and body are removed)  
3 empty lines separate each issue  
```

For example:
```
Feature: Add dark mode
Users should be able to switch to dark mode from settings.




Bug: Fix login issue
Some users cannot log in after the latest update.
```
See the [example](data-example/issues.txt) for more details.

The list of issues should be in a file named `issues.txt` in the `data/` directory.

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
